# How-Cool-Is-ChatGPT-and-the-importance-of-Prompt-Engineering

Hello, today I was studying the japanese alphabet and decided to test if Chat GPT would be able to create a simple, yet functional way for me to practice what I had been studying.
There are multiple online games to practice the japanese alphabet but this time I asked chat GPT to code me a website (html + css + js) that would show a japanese character and the
user would need to input the correct romanization of the word.

Anyone who has tried to ask Chat GPT for complex stuff has already dealt with a lot of disappointment and frustration with its wrong and absurd answers. However, with the use of
the prompt engineering technique, it is possible to help Chat GPT to give us a more desired answer. The general idea is to give the most explicit details and information about the 
task you want it to perform. In addition to that, it is also desired to give some simple examples, so that Chat GPT understands better what is the task it is being asked.

I was able to get a nice and functional code by writing commands to Chat GPT only twice (well actually thrice but the last time was due to its sassiness). Below were my commands to
Chat GPT:

1-
<mark>I want you to write me an html , css and java script file (of course if needed)

I want you to create an website that will show on the screen one of the characters from japanese hiragana or katakana. then the user will need to type the romanized writing for that japanese character.
For example: if on screen there is the character „Å¶ then the user should type te

If the user guesses the character correctly, I want the screen to flash green, then show a different japanese character. I want this to go on forever. I want it to be a kind of game to practice the user's japanese.

If the user types the incorrect answer, then I want the screen to flash red but remain with the same character on screen until the user types the correct character.</mark>
